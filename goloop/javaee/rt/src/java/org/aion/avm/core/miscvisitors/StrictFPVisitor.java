/**
 * This visitor is the simplest one we have.  All it does is apply the "strictfp" modifier to every method found.
 * Note that, although the Java language interprets this modifier being attached to a class, at the class file level,
 * it is a per-method modifier.
 * 
 * AKI-418:  This application is mostly being done for completeness, as it appears as though there may no longer
 * be hardware on which the JVM provides a "non-strict" mode.  Taking the x86 architecture as an example, using the
 * x87 FPU would produce non-strict values since it had a greater precision than IEEE 754.  However, the JVM now
 * implements floating-point operations via SSE, on that architecture, which natively exposes IEEE 754.
 * However, we still apply the flag since it is required to be strictly correct in all cases.
